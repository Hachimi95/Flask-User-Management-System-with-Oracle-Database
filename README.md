# "UEMF Articles" platform

The "UEMF Articles" platform aims to create a centralized solution for the 
UEMF University to share and access academic
articles and research papers.

The platform will be developed using the Python Flask framework and will
include two types of users : a simple user and an administrator.

The administrator will have full access, modification, and management rights,
while the simple users will have limited access within the platform.
The platform will be designed to respect the rights and responsibilities of
different user types, and multiple scenarios will be tested to ensure that
access rights are respected.
The end goal is to create a secure, user-friendly platform that promotes
collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and growth within the university
community using Python Flask and Oracle database integration."
